  As a Back-End Developer with 10 years of experience, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects involving various technologies and tools. My primary focus has been on designing, developing, and maintaining complex back-end systems.

  <br/><br/>

  With experience in FastAPI, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, I have gained expertise in building efficient and scalable back-end systems. I have worked on developing RESTful APIs, managing database interactions, and creating data models. My proficiency in FastAPI has enabled me to utilize modern Python features to build high-performance APIs.My proficiency in pytest enables me to create and execute tests that meticulously check the functionality and performance of software systems.Additionally, my knowledge of other unit test libraries enables me to tailor tests to meet the specific requirements of each project

  <br/><br/>

  Over the years, I have gained experience in data warehousing and have worked extensively with Informatica, Hive and PySpark for ETL processes. I have also acquired proficiency in cloud computing and have worked with AWS and Azure services. I have worked with various AWS services, including S3, ECS, SQS, SNS, Lambda, IAM, ELB, and DynamoDB. Additionally, I have experience working with Azure services like Blob, Azure Functions, and Azure VM. My experience with AWS services, such as Lambda, TimeStream DB, DynamoDB, and Step Functions, has equipped me with a strong skill set in designing and deploying serverless architectures and developing scalable applications

  <br/><br/>

  I have experience with containerization and have worked with Docker and Kubernetes. I am also familiar with Agile methodology and have worked on sprints to deliver projects on time. I have used Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. Overall, my comprehensive understanding of DevOps pipeline tools like GitLab equips me to deliver top-quality software solutions that meet business needs and comply with industry standards.
